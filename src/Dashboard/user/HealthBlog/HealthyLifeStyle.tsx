          <p>A balanced diet is crucial for good health and wellbeing. Aim to consume a variety of foods that provide all the essential nutrients your body needs:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li><strong>Fruits and Vegetables:</strong> Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. They provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Opt for whole grains like oats, brown rice, and whole wheat over refined grains. They are richer in fiber and help with digestion.</li>
            <li><strong>Lean Proteins:</strong> Include lean sources of protein like chicken, fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. These help in building muscles and repairing tissues.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Choose unsaturated fats found in olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocados while limiting saturated fats and trans fats.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water. Staying hydrated helps maintain the balance of bodily fluids and supports many essential bodily functions.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li><strong>Cardiovascular Exercise:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity every week. Activities like walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling are great for cardiovascular health.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> Include strength training exercises at least twice a week. Resistance exercises like lifting weights or using resistance bands help build and maintain muscle mass, which is important for metabolic health.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility and Balance Exercises:</strong> Practice yoga or stretching exercises to improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injuries. Balance exercises are especially important for older adults to prevent falls.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li><strong>Quality and Quantity:</strong> Adults should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Quality sleep helps restore energy, repair muscle tissue, and consolidate memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a Sleep Routine:</strong> Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize Your Sleep Environment:</strong> Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime, as blue light can interfere with sleep quality.</li>

            <li><strong>Mindfulness and Meditation:</strong> Practice mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, or meditation daily. These techniques help calm the mind and reduce anxiety.</li>
